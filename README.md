In this Final Project we import, clean, analyze and visualize data from home energy consumption, energy pool price and temperature.
I have added my own consumption report and also my own actual flatrate prices for differend contract times. Aim is to analyze the data
and see, if I have paid more or less, compared to pool prices.

Also, aim is to analyze consumption habit with pool price, and see how consumption habit need to be changed in order to gain more savings.
